Welcome to Fund Frontier, a NPV Calculator designed to empower users in making informed investment decisions. This program facilitates the evaluation of the Net Present Value (NPV) for up to three projects simultaneously, enabling a comprehensive analysis of their financial viability. The Net Present Value, a crucial financial metric, considers the time value of money to assess the profitability of an investment by calculating the present value of future cash flows.

## Features

#### Existing Features
1. Project Comparison: The tool supports the evaluation of 2 or 3 projects simultaneously for effective comparison.
2. Initial Investment: Users will enter the initial investment amount at the beginning of the project period.
3. Annual Net Cash Floor: The tool calculates the annual net cash flow at the end of each year, providing valuable insights into project profitability.
4. Discount Rate: Users can specify the discount rate to account for the time value of money.
5. NPV and Payback Period: The algorithm computes the NPV of the cash flow and determines the Payback period for each investment.
6. Project Ranking: Projects are ranked from highest to lowest NPV. If NPV is negative, the project is flagged for rejection. Users receive the NPV and Breakeven Period for informed decision-making.

#### Future Features
1. We would like to have the feature to add a different discount rates to different periods of a project.
